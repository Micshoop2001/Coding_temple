      Hey guys, my name is Michael Shoop I live in Hickory North Carolina which
      is an hour east of Ashville and an hour north of Charlotte. I’m originally
      from a small town in rural Appalachia called Big Stone Gap. It’s in far
      western Virginia. Currently I’m working as a GIS Analyst. I’m a certified
      professional with a master’s degree in spatial analysis and I make okay
      money, but I need to try and make more money to support my wife and me.
      Whether that involves taking what I learn here and adapting it to GIS
      Development or leaving GIS behind and becoming a software engineer I don’t
      know yet. I’m really excited to start the journey and learn skillsets I’ve
      wanted to pick up for years.
